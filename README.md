# SCMA-codebook
This projected contains all designed codebooks by the author, as well as the codebooks collected in the existing works

1. ''SSD-SCMA'' contains our current work of SCMA codebook design and relevant results in  "Enhancing Signal Space Diversity for SCMA
Systems Over Rayleigh Fading Channels".


2. "CB_autoencoder contains" our learned codebook in the paper ''A Novel Multi-Task Learning Empowered Codebook Design for Downlink SCMA Networks'' (published in WCL).

3. "LP-SCMA" contains our current work  of SCMA codebook design with low-complexity of decoding.

4. "Good Multidimensioanl constellation" contains our newly design MD constellations in the paper ''Designing Enhanced Multi-dimensional
Constellations for Code-Domain NOMA'' (published in WCL)

5. "CODEBOOK-COLLECTIONS"  is the codebook set of existing works. 

6. ''NC-SCMA'': the designed codebook for the paper " A Novel Non-Coherent SCMA with Massive MIMO" (published in WCL)

7. VM-SCMA: to be uploaded soon.
   
9. SCMA-Platform:   to be uploaded soon.
