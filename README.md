# SCMA-codebook
This projected contains all designed codebooks by the author, as well as the codebooks collected in the existing works

1. "CB_autoencoder contains" our learned codebook in the paper ''A Novel Multi-Task Learning Empowered Codebook Design for Downlink SCMA Networks'' (published by WCL).

2. "LP-SCMA" contains our current work  of SCMA codebook design with low-complexity of decoding, i.e., "A Design of Low-Projection SCMA Codebooks for
Downlink Satellite Internet of Things" (submitted to xxx).

3. "Good Multidimensioanl constellation" contains our newly design MD constellations in the paper ''Designing Enhanced Multi-dimensional
Constellations for Code-Domain NOMA‘’ (accepted by WCL)

4. "CODEBOOK-COLLECTIONS"  is the codebook set of existing works. Will be updated in an organized way after submitted the topic 6.

5. ''NC-SCMA'': the designed codebook for the paper " A Novel Non-Coherent SCMA with Massive MIMO" (accepted to WCL)
