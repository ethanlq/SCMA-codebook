# SCMA-codebook
This projected contains all designed codebooks by the author, as well as the codebooks collected in the existing works

1. CB_autoencoder contains our learned codebook in the paper ''A Novel Multi-Task Learning Empowered Codebook Design for Downlink SCMA Networks''

2. LP-SCMA contains our current work  of SCMA codebook design with low-complexity of decoding, i.e., "A Design of Low-Projection SCMA Codebooks for
Downlink Satellite Internet of Things".

3. CODEBOOK-COLLECTIONS  is the codebook set of existing works.

4. NC-SCMA: The designed codebook for the paper " A Novel Non-Coherent SCMA with Massive MIMO"
